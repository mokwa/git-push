        <p>Habits dictate what we think, how we spend our time, and what we achieve… </p>

      <h2>Be a positive influence</h2>
      <p>Happiness is contagious! So by developing an optimistic outlook on life, smiling more, and generally being cheerful, you’re turning yourself into someone that others want to be around.</p>
      <h2>Focus on self-growth</h2>
      <p>Successful people are always improving. And that doesn’t mean you have to be chasing a promotion day-in-day-out. According to the Japanese business philosophy of Kaizen (meaning improvement), making small changes on a regular basis means you’ll benefit from bigger accomplishments in the long term – without having to sacrifice your time.

      The key? With everything you do, ask yourself if there’s a better way of doing it (hint: there almost always is). Figure it out, and implement it.</p>

      <h2>Track your progress </h2>
      <p>Whether it’s what you’ve learnt, what you need to learn, what you’ve contributed, or anything else related to your professional development – it’s vital to make a note of it.
        This will not only allow you to reward yourself for achievements, it’ll also help you to stay on top of your to-do-list.
        So at the end of every day, ask yourself ‘what have I learned?’, ‘what did I contribute?’ and ‘what can I action?’. Keeping a log of your annual objectives for both your personal and work-life is also a good way to ensure you’re covering the big picture. </p>
